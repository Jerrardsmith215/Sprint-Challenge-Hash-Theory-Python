1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

    A regular expression is an abstract statement that, on the lowest level, assigns some value(s) to a place in the computer's memory.

2. What is an array and how does it work?

    An array is a contiguous set of addresses in the computer's memory in which data of the same type is contained. 

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

    A hash table is essentially an array containing linked lists of data. Hash tables work by creating an array of linked lists from passed in key-value pairs. Because an array can only use one data type, the key must be processed through a "hashing function" whose purpose is to make the key data acceptable for the table and assign it an index in the table. Next the value for that key is converted into a linked list item and placed at its appropiate index. This makes it possible to have the time/space complexity of an array while managing data of different types on the high level.
